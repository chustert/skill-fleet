# Issue tracker configuration

GitHub is the source of truth for this project's work items. The workflow skills in `.agents/skills/` read this file for tracker settings instead of hard-coding them. Resolve project, field, item, and option identifiers from GitHub every time; never record them here.

`TODO` marks a value nobody has confirmed. `None` means the project deliberately does without it.

## Tracker settings

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Default repository | TODO: `owner/repo`. A bare issue number refers to this repository. |
| Owner type | TODO: `Organization` or `User`. GitHub issue types exist only for organizations. |
| Issue types | TODO: `Resolve from GitHub` when the organization uses them, otherwise `None`. |
| Fallback repository | TODO: where a new issue goes when its owning component is unclear. |
| Project board | TODO: the board's exact title and owner, such as `Sprints` owned by `acme`, or `None`. |
| Status field | TODO: the single-select field that holds the lifecycle status, usually `Status`, or `None`. |
| Lifecycle statuses | TODO: new → `Todo`; started → `In progress`; in review → `In review`; done → `Done`. |
| Iteration field | TODO: the iteration field's name, such as `Sprint`, or `None`. |
| Sprint time zone | TODO: an IANA time zone, such as `Europe/Berlin`. |
| Default base branch | TODO: `main`. |
| Branch format | `<category>/<issue-number>-<slug>`, such as `feature/12-export-button`. |
| Labels | Use existing labels only. Typical mapping: TODO defect → `bug`, new capability → `enhancement`, documentation → `documentation`. |

## Routing

Each row is a component: a unit of ownership and verification. In a single repository the path column separates components. In a workspace of independent repositories each repository is usually one component.

| Component | Repository | Local path | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | `owner/repo` | `.` | TODO: what this component is responsible for, in the project's own words |

Mark a legacy or inactive component in its `Owns` cell, such as "Legacy API. Route work here only when an issue explicitly targets it." Give a repository that holds only planning or umbrella issues the local path `None`.

Work that spans components: TODO, such as "one issue in the default repository, unless it is too large for one reviewable pull request" or "an umbrella issue in `owner/planning` with a linked implementation issue in each affected repository".

Do not route work to a repository this table does not list. Inspect and register it first with `setup-project`.

## Operations

- Read issues and pull requests to understand scope and acceptance criteria.
- Link every issue, pull request, comment, or project item you name, following `.agents/references/github-references.md`.
- Before creating, editing, labelling, assigning, commenting on, or closing an issue, present the intended change unless the user's current request already authorizes it.
- Use the repository's existing labels. Do not create labels without explicit approval.
- Pull requests are not a triage request surface by default.

## Specifications

A longer specification may live in the repository when needed, but it links to the owning issue and does not create a parallel backlog.
